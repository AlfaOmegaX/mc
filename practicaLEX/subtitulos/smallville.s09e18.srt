1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:01,746
Previously on Smallville...

2
00:00:01,932 --> 00:00:04,284
<i>I've picked out a nice little</i>
<i>font for my exposé.</i>

3
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,450
I actually had another
headline in mind.

4
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:09,238
"The Blur murders Lois Lane."

5
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:10,439
Ugh!

6
00:00:10,474 --> 00:00:11,607
Ugh!

7
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:13,209
Ugh! No!

8
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:17,754
I know you're out there somewhere!

9
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,515
I've been keeping an eye on you.

10
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:21,218
I have to see you.

11
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:22,869
How do you feel about phone booths?

12
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,773
Hello?

13
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:27,455
This is the Red-Blue Blur.
I received your letter.

14
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:29,064
What I've really
been wondering is...

15
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,246
What is it that you need?

16
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:31,623
I need your help.

17
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:33,475
But you can't tell anyone about it.

18
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:34,486
I promise.

19
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:35,862
I wouldn't ask, Lois,

20
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:37,327
if it weren't a matter
of life or death.

21
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:39,127
Welcome to Checkmate.

22
00:00:39,632 --> 00:00:41,370
We've been blocked by a new player.

23
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:53,638
How do you get yourself
into these things, Lane?

24
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:01,857
Good to see you. Hey.

25
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:04,894
The guy's inside, boss.
Says he'll only show it to you.

26
00:01:04,928 --> 00:01:07,503
Wants to collect the
million-dollar reward.

27
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:08,555
Really.

28
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,799
Ladies.

29
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,967
Hey, dollface.

30
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:15,271
Ah, my old friend.
It's been too long.

31
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:17,907
Hey.

32
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:22,411
Glad to have you back, Ray.

33
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:24,678
Good to be back, darling.

34
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:50,153
Well...

35
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:54,510
As your ex-district attorney...

36
00:01:55,193 --> 00:01:58,514
I'd like to thank you all for
joining me in celebrating

37
00:01:58,548 --> 00:02:00,297
the national treasure

38
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,352
that is our American
justice system.

39
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:05,087
You know...

40
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:07,623
they kicked me out of office...

41
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:11,227
they charged me with
attempted murder...

42
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:13,262
They even tried to
put me away for life,

43
00:02:13,296 --> 00:02:15,030
and yet...

44
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:17,433
here I am.

45
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,817
So...

46
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,565
I understand you have
something for me.

47
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:40,607
What about my million dollars?

48
00:02:44,222 --> 00:02:45,737
Don't test me, son.

49
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:20,955
Lois!

50
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:23,165
Clark?

51
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:36,812
I told you to find the story.

52
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:39,025
Not <i>be</i> the story.

53
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,786
One of you want to
tell me what happened?

54
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:52,861
Let me guess.

55
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:55,297
You two have a lovers' spat?

56
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:59,401
Clark and I don't spat.

57
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:01,503
There was no spatting.

58
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:03,272
What Lois is saying is that we try

59
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:06,008
not to let our personal lives
get in the way of our jobs.

60
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,577
Well, you don't have
to "try" anymore.

61
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:14,804
Because you're both fired.

78
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,435
Chloe.

79
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:36,437
Can you believe it? I'm early.

80
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:38,872
No, Lois, "early"
is when you arrive

81
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:40,607
at your destination by a set time,

82
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:42,776
not when you can see it
from seven blocks away.

83
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:45,813
Unh-unh, nobody's raining
on this girl's parade today.

84
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,148
Clark's taking me up
to the roof tonight

85
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:49,817
to do a little stargazing.

86
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,018
O-Kay.

87
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:54,321
That explains the 911
to the craigslist queen.

88
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:56,090
Long live the queen.

89
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:59,760
I can't believe you
got one so fast.

90
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,830
I kind of noticed that Clark
has this thing for telescopes.

91
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:04,431
Do you think he'll like it?

92
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:09,036
But what is it exactly
about a telescope

93
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,705
that merits 76 trombones
<i>and big parade?</i>

94
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:14,675
Well...

95
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,111
Tonight's the night.

96
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:19,546
In the words of the general...

97
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:21,982
it's time to drop
the L-bomb. What?!

98
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:25,386
You mean to tell me that you guys
haven' volleyed <i>the</i> word yet?

99
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,823
Among other significant
relationship milestones.

100
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:32,993
I don't know -- things used
to be easier with Clark,

101
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:34,828
you know, back in the
days when you'd wake up

102
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:36,864
and the first thing
you'd do is check

103
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:38,132
for a text or an e-mail,

104
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,234
and it'd be there, waiting for you?

105
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,770
Anyway, things have
been different...

106
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:44,738
Ever since we decided
we could keep secrets

107
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,640
from each other.

108
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:50,043
But that's all changing tonight.

109
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:52,179
Wait a minute. Secrets?

110
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,081
Uh, changing how?

111
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,684
No more secrets.

112
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:00,120
It's time to take our
baggage out of the closet.

113
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:01,722
I mean, if we "L" each other,

114
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:03,023
then..

115
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:06,026
<i>nothing</i> should come between us,
right?

116
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,514
Hey! Do you ever
check your voicemail?

117
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:28,849
Looks like somebody missed

118
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,784
breakfast in bed with
Oliver this morning.

119
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:33,053
I'm not here to talk about my love life.
That makes two of us.

120
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:34,521
I'm here to talk about yours. Whoa.

121
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:35,689
Can't we just stick to a topic

122
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,024
like aliens assimilating the earth?

123
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,759
This isn't about
assimilating, Clark.

124
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,260
Zod has powers now,

125
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,362
and you told him all
of your secrets.

126
00:07:42,397 --> 00:07:44,898
This is not a good time
to bring Lois in, too.

127
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:46,033
Lois? Yeah.

128
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:47,634
She told me about
your big date tonight

129
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:49,703
where you both are gonna
come clean with everything.

130
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:51,905
I'm not gonna tell Lois anything.

131
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,608
I'm making Lois dinner tonight
so she shares <i>her</i> secret.

132
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,510
She's been keeping
something from me.

133
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,846
I didn't want to use my
abilities to spy on her.

134
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,347
It's been driving me crazy.

135
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:02,316
So you're gonna
seduce it out of her?

136
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,851
Clark, you're the
reason all of this

137
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:05,085
is happening to begin with.

138
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,887
I have not called her
as The Blur in months.

139
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,088
That doesn't matter, Clark.

140
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:09,923
The second that your
back-in-black alter ego

141
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:11,291
asked Lois to lie about the Blur

142
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:12,659
was the day that you asked her

143
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:14,194
to lie to the person
that she loves,

144
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:15,329
which is you.

145
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:18,832
<i>And</i> she did.

146
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:23,036
A relationship with
secrets can never work.

147
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:25,239
Look at you and Oliver.
Everything's out in the open.

148
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:27,941
That is because we both
understand that our relationship

149
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:29,710
comes second to a higher calling.

150
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:30,844
Clark, you and Lois --

151
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,412
don't have to be any different.

152
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:34,314
Now, if Lois is gonna
trust me tonight,

153
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:37,084
maybe it's time I trusted her.

154
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,738
Hey.

155
00:08:57,772 --> 00:08:59,606
Hey.

156
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:02,276
Did you, uh, get my message?

157
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,311
Yep.

158
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:09,483
So, we're still on for tonight?

159
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,388
Definitely.

160
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:18,091
What's in the box?

161
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:20,694
A surprise.

162
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:25,198
It's gonna be a long day.

163
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:29,736
Yep.

164
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:34,741
How about a sneak preview?

165
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:47,287
Sometimes, I swear you
have more than two hands.

166
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:52,893
Either that kiss altered
my sense of time and space

167
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,895
or this place is busier than usual.

168
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,196
It's a big news day.

169
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,298
I think it has something
to do with our new editor.

170
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,533
Another editor?

171
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,568
They should just install
a rotating door up there.

172
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:03,003
Obviously, our illustrious owner

173
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:05,038
has just spun some big
wheel of fortune in the sky

174
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:08,942
to see who'd be steering
the ship this week.

175
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:13,113
Well...

176
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:16,483
I guess I pulled the
lucky number this week.

177
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,185
Franklin Stern.

178
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:23,156
You must be the lovely and
charming miss Lane, I presume.

179
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:26,259
Uh, miss Lane is an acquired taste.

180
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:30,597
I-it's just that ever
since Tess went away,

181
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:32,399
we've gone through
a lot of editors.

182
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,101
Well, not for long.

183
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:36,036
The board just launched
a global search

184
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,105
for the next editor-in-chief.

185
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,742
And I intend to make
their decision very easy.

186
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:44,011
And you decided to
start your campaign

187
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:46,046
by downsizing the desk inventory?

188
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,981
Miss Lane...

189
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:54,454
...I've been, uh, reading
through the personnel files

190
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:57,290
to identify any red flags,

191
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:59,860
and I understand you two

192
00:10:59,894 --> 00:11:03,063
are entangled in an
interoffice relationship.

193
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:06,066
No. No, sir.

194
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,368
Yeah. Right.

195
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:11,605
Well, for whatever reason,
it seems you're both spending

196
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,807
so much time out of the office

197
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,076
trying to reel in the big fish,

198
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,211
you're not delivering
the daily catch.

199
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:19,980
To be fair, sir,
we've both turned in

200
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,081
some pretty big stories.

201
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,683
Here's a bigger one --

202
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:26,119
our fair city's disgraced D.
A., Ray Sacks,

203
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:29,022
just had is life sentence reversed.

204
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:31,124
He gets out o prison today.

205
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,762
Only one of these stays on the desk

206
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:37,097
at the end of the day.

207
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:43,003
May the best reporter win.

208
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:27,804
Oliver gave you keys to his office.

209
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:30,773
He must trust you with just
about all of his secrets.

210
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:32,542
Tess.

211
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:34,410
I thought you were
supposed to be underground.

212
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:36,045
You know, if you're
having a hard time

213
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,947
finding your way there,
I'm sure I could help.

214
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:41,451
So we're over the temporary truce

215
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:43,653
and straight back to "
fire at will."

216
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:45,655
Okay.

217
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:47,757
Just remember, Chloe,
that out there,

218
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,392
I might be M.I.A., but in here...

219
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:51,060
I'm still C.E.O.

220
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,267
Where <i>is</i> Oliver?

221
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:01,971
Out of town.

222
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,612
I was curious how you two...

223
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:11,647
got into each other's orbit.

224
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:13,850
Mutual friends,

225
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:16,018
which I understand you could
use some help finding,

226
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:18,321
considering the fact that you
have to go to outer space

227
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:20,089
to look for them.

228
00:13:20,124 --> 00:13:22,692
The Kandorians?

229
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:27,130
You'll see, Chloe, they're
better as allies than enemies.

230
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:29,232
Clark gets that.

231
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,933
Why don't you and Oliver?

232
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:32,969
Clark optimistically thinks

233
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:36,172
that Zod will be happy wearing
an apron and slinging coffees.

234
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:38,141
We don't...

235
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,409
Especially now that he has powers.

236
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:44,280
"We"?

237
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:46,516
As in, you and Green Arrow?

238
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:50,353
Chloe...

239
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:53,256
I get what you see in your heroes,

240
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,692
but what do they see in you?

241
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:58,794
I could ask Zod the
same question about you,

242
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:00,830
but I guess I don't
have to anymore.

243
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:03,166
I've been watching you two,
and it seems like Zod

244
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,004
hasn't been home for
dinner for quite a while.

245
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:10,540
Be careful, miss Mercer.

246
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:14,644
At this rate, you're gonna
run out of people to betray.

247
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:25,488
I don't know what's worse, Clark --

248
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:27,390
that they freed the D.A.
that threw me off the roof

249
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:28,925
or that our editor
threw us in the ring

250
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,126
to wrestle for the same desk.

251
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,861
Don't worry --
if we land a big enough story,

252
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:33,763
we can save both our jobs.

253
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:35,898
Now, in order for him
to reverse his sentence,

254
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,367
Sacks must still have powerful
friends down at City Hall.

255
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:40,169
And according to the
underground blogs,

256
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:42,505
he's having a "welcome home"
party tonight at Maxwell's.

257
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:44,340
Crime kingpins like to
keep out the outsiders.

258
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:45,975
It'd be easier to
crash the White House

259
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,677
than it would be to
sneak into that party.

260
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:52,048
Look, we only have till the end
of the day to get this done.

261
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:53,883
I think we'd cover more
ground I we split the work.

262
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,686
That's a good idea.

263
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:01,023
Can't wait for tonight.

264
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:11,467
Hey, it's me -- Lois.
Guess you're out.

265
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:13,736
It's strange to think that I can
leave a message for The Blur.

266
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,204
I mean, well, not strange/weird --

267
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,572
it's just -- you know what I mean.

268
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:18,507
It's hard to picture The
Blur screening his calls --

269
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,710
not that you'd be screening <i>my</i>
calls or anything, but I d--

270
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:23,112
Me again. Got cut off.

271
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:24,647
You know, that's not lot of time

272
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:25,948
for someone to leave a message.

273
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,516
That beep comes at you pretty fast.

274
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,252
Then again, you are The Blur,
of course.

275
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:31,087
I'm sure you'd like it fast,
but I just --

276
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:33,656
Here's the deal.

277
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,391
I'm on a story about
our deadly ex-D.A.

278
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:37,827
Now, normally, I'd be working
with my partner in reporting,

279
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:39,462
but I want to keep
him safe, secure,

280
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:43,199
and as far away from Sacks and
his murderous mob as I can.

281
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,134
Clark's not bulletproof,
but you are.

282
00:15:45,168 --> 00:15:47,236
Be my wingman?

283
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:55,278
Lois <i>will</i> find a way to see Sacks
before the party tonight.

284
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:56,779
Chloe, I have to find him first.

285
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:57,913
Look, I get it, Clark.

286
00:15:57,948 --> 00:15:59,882
I'm spending a small
fortune of Oliver's money

287
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,817
to update the security
system here at Watchtower.

288
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:02,952
Plus I have a satellite

289
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:04,654
trained on your
fortress at all times

290
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:06,188
now that Zod knows your zip code.

291
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:07,290
I understand the instinct

292
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:08,891
to protect the ones that you love.

293
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:11,594
You know, half of being in
a relationship with Lois

294
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:13,562
is protecting her from herself.

295
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,298
Actually, she's not the only one

296
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:16,999
Sacks is gunning for right now.

297
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:18,334
According to the Internet,

298
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:20,269
he's offering a
million-dollar reward

299
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:23,005
for anyone who can supply him
with an image of The Blur.

300
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,441
Again? What's with this guy and
his obsession with The Blur?

301
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:27,243
Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

302
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,880
you publicly disgraced him
and threw him in prison.

303
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:33,616
Since he's been out,
I have a hard time tracking him down.

304
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:36,886
Well, Sacks is all about the V.
I.P. treatment.

305
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,888
Maybe he's got a favorite
bar or restaurant.

306
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:43,292
Someplace that he
would want to go to

307
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:45,294
after being locked
down for eight months.

308
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:48,164
Ah.

309
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:51,634
Our paroled prosecutor <i>does</i>
have a favorite haunt,

310
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:55,671
but it isn't exactly five-star.

311
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:07,149
Mr. Sacks, Lois Lane from
<i>The Daily Planet.</i>

312
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:10,219
You may remember me from the
roof of <i>The Daily Planet.</i>

313
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:13,189
Oh, yes. Yes, I remember you.

314
00:17:13,223 --> 00:17:14,490
You have a nasty habit

315
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:16,959
of always landing on your feet,
don't you, Lane?

316
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:19,028
And now I need to land a story.

317
00:17:19,062 --> 00:17:21,230
So, who let you out of your cage?

318
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:23,399
Since I'm the one that
you sent skydiving

319
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,067
without a parachute,

320
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:27,069
I figure I'm at least owed a quote.

321
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:29,672
You have too much faith
in The Blur, Lane,

322
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:33,542
to think you can meet
with me like this alone.

323
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:38,481
My editor knows where I am.

324
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,950
Hurt me, and you'll
be back behind bars

325
00:17:40,984 --> 00:17:42,852
before this pizza cools off.

326
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:45,888
Oh, I won't hurt you, no. He will.

327
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:48,657
And this time,
they won't find me guilty

328
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,927
because they'll never
find your body.

329
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:08,878
It's him! Come on! Go! Go!

330
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:18,120
Wait!

331
00:18:18,155 --> 00:18:20,456
Thank you...

332
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,791
for saving my bacon.

333
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:24,493
I'd be two strips of
pain on the pavement

334
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:26,529
if you hadn't gotten my call.

335
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,764
What call?

336
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,268
You have no idea what it means
that you trusted me enough

337
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:34,770
to let me help you
these past weeks.

338
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:38,674
I have never felt such a sense
of purpose in my entire life.

339
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,075
Whatever you need...

340
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,412
you can count on me.

341
00:18:57,794 --> 00:18:59,795
Payday.

342
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,030
T-that million's mine.

343
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:04,633
I g-- I got a picture of The Blur!

344
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,503
What you've got is two choices --

345
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:09,004
you either trash that photo,

346
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,339
or I throw <i>you</i> <i>in he trash!</i>

347
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:11,907
Ugh!

348
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:29,625
Lois, stop!

349
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:31,961
Who are you calling?

350
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:33,295
It's not important, Clark.

351
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,364
No, that's The Blur, isn't it?

352
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,533
Why would you think that?

353
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,768
And what are you even doing here?

354
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,539
Lois, you told me that you
stopped talking to The Blur.

355
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:48,410
All those secrets that you've
been keeping from me --

356
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:50,646
it's him, isn't it?

357
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,782
Okay, this is between
The Blur and me.

358
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,018
That's all I can tell you.

359
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:58,754
Lois, do you even know who
you're really talking to?

360
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,657
Okay, what's going on here?

361
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,325
Clark, you don't
need to be jealous.

362
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,760
No, I'm not. I just --

363
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:07,329
Lois, I need to know who that is.

364
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:10,866
You did not just ask me that.

365
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:15,738
Is this about the story?

366
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:18,407
You want me to give up The
Blur just to save our job?

367
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:20,676
Lois, I'm trying
to save <i>you.</i>

368
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,278
Don't -- don't you think that,
sometimes,

369
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:24,013
you might have a little
too much blind faith?

370
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,849
Why? Because if he trusted me,
he'd show himself? Is that it?

371
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:29,818
Lois.

372
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,321
Okay, I need you to listen to me.

373
00:20:32,355 --> 00:20:33,589
No, Clark...

374
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:36,892
I am sure he is dyin tell me,

375
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:38,861
but how could anyone
who cares about me

376
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:40,563
put me in that kind of position?

377
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:43,198
I-if I knew his true identity,

378
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:45,768
then every lowlife with
high hopes of hurting him

379
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:47,436
would come after me,

380
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,439
and he would never put
me in that kind of danger

381
00:20:50,473 --> 00:20:52,241
just to get a secret off his back.

382
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:54,243
That's why I trust him.

383
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:19,823
I take it your search for
Sacks didn't go so well.

384
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:23,260
I found Sacks,
but I may have lost Lois,

385
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:26,129
or at least her trust.

386
00:21:26,164 --> 00:21:27,297
Oh, no.

387
00:21:27,332 --> 00:21:30,267
I know that look. What happened?

388
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:33,670
I did this to myself, Chloe.

389
00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:36,540
I asked Lois to keep her
calls with The Blur a secret,

390
00:21:36,574 --> 00:21:38,308
and she did...

391
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:39,810
even from me

392
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:42,779
and now someone else is calling
her pretending to be The Blur.

393
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:45,816
Why? Who would want to
Blur a mile your shoes?

394
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,451
I don't know -- Checkmate,
Zod, Tess.

395
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:50,888
They've all been
circling my secret.

396
00:21:50,922 --> 00:21:53,724
I stole her phone to see
who she was calling.

397
00:21:53,758 --> 00:21:55,626
She's already deleted the list.

398
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,929
You know, as much as I don't want to,
I have to say...

399
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:00,964
it's pretty impressive
how committed Lois is

400
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:02,399
to protecting The Blur.

401
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:03,700
From me.

402
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:05,769
Yeah, talk about a
Kafkaesque nightmare.

403
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:08,005
I almost ended it all
and told her everything

404
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:11,108
till she reminded me why I can never
put her in that kind of danger.

405
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:15,979
Look, I need to find whosever
lying to Lois using my identity.

406
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:18,048
She said she had
something to tell him.

407
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:20,150
And you want Watchtower
to trace the call.

408
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:21,952
Got it.

409
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:30,594
I would have called you on my cell,
but I can't find it.

410
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:32,930
Listen, someone photographed
you on their phone,

411
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:35,032
and they're about to
sell it to Ray Sacks.

412
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,199
I don't know when you'll get this,

413
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:37,534
so I'll blitz his bash at Maxwell's

414
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:39,002
and try to run interference,

415
00:22:39,037 --> 00:22:41,104
but you need to get
there as soon you can.

416
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:00,524
Piece of cake.

417
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:06,029
... with attempted murder.

418
00:23:06,064 --> 00:23:07,998
They even tried to
put me away for life,

419
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,433
and yet...

420
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:10,801
here I am.

421
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:20,143
So, uh...

422
00:23:20,178 --> 00:23:23,080
I understand you have
something for me.

423
00:23:23,114 --> 00:23:25,048
What about my million dollars?

424
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,387
Don't test me, son.

425
00:23:57,281 --> 00:23:59,816
Lois!

426
00:24:01,285 --> 00:24:02,886
Clark?

427
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,826
Oops.

428
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:13,196
Sorry about your million dollars.

429
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:23,707
Oh, that's okay, kid.

430
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:25,742
We don't need that picture.

431
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:44,528
We just need you.

432
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,998
Three years of selfless
service to this paper,

433
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:50,267
and the new editor on the
block just up and fires me.

434
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:51,501
Well, not just you, Lois.

435
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:53,503
Well, at least one of us
would have kept their job

436
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:56,973
if you hadn't been so obsessed
with unmasking The Blur.

437
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:59,076
I don't know how you found
out about that photo,

438
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,577
but crashing Sacks' party?

439
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:02,879
Just how many hurdles
are you willing to jump

440
00:25:02,914 --> 00:25:05,716
to expose the person that
I'm trying to protect?

441
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,018
You jumped out of a cake,
Lois, and you slugged me.

442
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:09,619
It was just a distraction.

443
00:25:09,654 --> 00:25:11,354
I had to do something extreme

444
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:13,757
to destroy that extremely
dangerous picture,

445
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:14,991
no thanks to you.

446
00:25:15,026 --> 00:25:16,693
Lois. No, save it.

447
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:18,795
I don't know why you suddenly
have it in for The Blur,

448
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,630
but whatever you're
gonna tell me right now

449
00:25:20,665 --> 00:25:22,032
isn't gonna make a difference.

450
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:23,934
I'm seeing a whole other
side of you, Clark,

451
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,436
and for the first time...

452
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:28,472
I'm not a fan of the view.

453
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:20,731
I take it this is the official
invitation to join you --

454
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:22,500
the black king.

455
00:26:22,534 --> 00:26:24,502
Your work on this operation

456
00:26:24,536 --> 00:26:29,307
has proven to be
surprisingly invaluable.

457
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:33,911
They have all witnessed The Blur.

458
00:26:33,946 --> 00:26:35,746
Pieces of his identity

459
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:38,349
have been locked
within their minds.

460
00:26:38,383 --> 00:26:42,120
They simply need to be severed.

461
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:44,322
And you're extracting
their memories

462
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:48,593
with this whole "Jedi
mind control" thing.

463
00:26:56,935 --> 00:27:00,605
Very impressive
interrogation skills.

464
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:04,809
Listen, Mr. Lord,
I am no friend of The Blur,

465
00:27:04,843 --> 00:27:08,513
but why are <i>you</i> after him?

466
00:27:08,547 --> 00:27:11,682
You are aware, Sacks, that...

467
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:14,752
Metahumans exist on the planet.

468
00:27:14,786 --> 00:27:17,622
I assume this Checkmate agency

469
00:27:17,656 --> 00:27:21,859
wants to use them to
protect and serve?

470
00:27:21,894 --> 00:27:24,428
That's the white queen's plan.

471
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:28,599
Waller barks orders
from behind a desk.

472
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:30,701
I work in the real world,

473
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:35,640
a world that needs the rule of law.

474
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:39,544
Anything outside the
natural order is...

475
00:27:39,578 --> 00:27:41,078
unpredictable.

476
00:27:41,113 --> 00:27:43,981
Now, correct me if I'm wrong --

477
00:27:44,016 --> 00:27:46,651
you have powers...

478
00:27:46,685 --> 00:27:48,386
You're one of them.

479
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:53,958
Which is exactly why I know
how dangerous they can be

480
00:27:53,992 --> 00:27:55,826
and why I plan...

481
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:57,728
on eliminating them.

482
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:14,512
Chloe, when did you find this?

483
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:16,214
Can't you get a clearer picture?

484
00:28:16,248 --> 00:28:17,949
Whoa, Clark, okay, one at a time.

485
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:19,150
I was following Lois

486
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:21,152
just in case she found
Sacks before you did,

487
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:23,821
and I got the security footage
from a camera 60 floors up.

488
00:28:23,855 --> 00:28:25,990
Now, unfortunately, zoom technology

489
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:28,326
isn't exactly on par
with X-ray vision.

490
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,595
Where was Lois taken?

491
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:32,196
I don't know.

492
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:35,866
I lost the car right after
it went into Rombauer Tunnel.

493
00:28:35,901 --> 00:28:37,635
This has to be Sacks.

494
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:38,869
I did some digging.

495
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:40,838
Right around the time that
our devious D.A. walked,

496
00:28:40,872 --> 00:28:43,207
all his new little prison friends
who were sent up the river

497
00:28:43,242 --> 00:28:44,475
were transferred off the grid.

498
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:45,643
Chloe, I know these guys.

499
00:28:45,677 --> 00:28:47,445
I put every one of
them behind bars.

500
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:49,013
They're all violent offenders,

501
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:50,915
and the only person who can
authorize their transfer

502
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:52,817
is the Governor

503
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:54,252
who did you say

504
00:28:54,286 --> 00:28:56,354
threw Sacks' little
"welcome home" mobster ball?

505
00:28:56,388 --> 00:28:58,289
Some tycoon named Maxwell Lord.

506
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:00,057
Three guesses who the
largest contributor

507
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:02,360
to the governor's
re-election fund was.

508
00:29:06,632 --> 00:29:08,266
With that kind of influence,

509
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,167
Lord has some serious
strings he can pull.

510
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:11,702
If Maxwell Lord wants The Blur,

511
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:13,904
that's exactly who he'll get.

512
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:20,978
You should see Lord's
setup downstairs.

513
00:29:21,013 --> 00:29:23,514
This guy is a major player,

514
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:26,817
and he has just given me...

515
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:28,686
the key to the city.

516
00:29:43,502 --> 00:29:46,203
Checkmate.

517
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:14,932
You're fighting it.

518
00:30:16,635 --> 00:30:18,669
You know him, don't you?

519
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:21,439
Get away from her!

520
00:30:23,308 --> 00:30:25,209
Ah.

521
00:30:25,243 --> 00:30:28,546
I see we're past
formal introductions.

522
00:30:29,648 --> 00:30:30,548
Stop.

523
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:32,750
One wrong step...

524
00:30:32,784 --> 00:30:36,454
and I'll eviscerate every
last thought in her head.

525
00:30:41,593 --> 00:30:44,829
You're using their memories
to learn my identity.

526
00:30:44,863 --> 00:30:47,298
Let them go.
They don't know who I am.

527
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:48,566
True.

528
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,935
They've only seen glimpses
of your face -- nothing more.

529
00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:53,637
You've been careful.

530
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:55,806
Except for this one.

531
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:57,842
Even unconscious...

532
00:30:57,876 --> 00:31:00,578
her mind protects memories of you.

533
00:31:00,612 --> 00:31:02,480
Maybe she doesn't have any.

534
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:06,150
Or maybe the connection
between you two...

535
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:08,419
is stronger.

536
00:31:08,453 --> 00:31:11,122
Stronger than the fear that
binds you with the others,

537
00:31:11,156 --> 00:31:13,958
stronger...

538
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:16,093
because of love.

539
00:32:00,806 --> 00:32:03,774
You're here.

540
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:15,085
I-I can't know who you are.

541
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,623
I'd give anything
to see your face...

542
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:22,460
... to know your name.

543
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:29,467
But you can't protect us
if we know who you are.

544
00:32:32,003 --> 00:32:35,139
I understand that now.

545
00:32:53,325 --> 00:32:54,558
Go.

546
00:33:27,577 --> 00:33:31,280
Sorry, Max. Little
change of itinerary.

547
00:34:02,912 --> 00:34:05,047
So it's true --

548
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:09,184
the red queen <i>does</i> exist.

549
00:34:19,262 --> 00:34:20,996
I guess the upside to unemployment

550
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:23,999
is you on't have to pick
out a tie every morning.

551
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:25,968
You're beating yourself up,
aren't you?

552
00:34:26,002 --> 00:34:27,936
Oh, which "me"?

553
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:30,105
The Blur that Lois
would die to protect

554
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,141
or the boyfriend that Lois
is protecting him from?

555
00:34:32,175 --> 00:34:34,009
Don't be so hard
on yourself, Clark.

556
00:34:34,044 --> 00:34:35,611
Not everyone with a press pass

557
00:34:35,645 --> 00:34:38,213
is also moonlighting as the
city's greatest superhero.

558
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:40,382
And the whole
phone/rooftop/blur thing --

559
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:42,418
at least give yourself
creative points

560
00:34:42,452 --> 00:34:45,054
for trying to be as honest
as you could with Lois.

561
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:47,122
I guess if half of
me has Lois' trust

562
00:34:47,157 --> 00:34:48,991
and the other half
gets the rest of her,

563
00:34:49,025 --> 00:34:50,693
it all works out in some weird way.

564
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:55,397
There's only one
problem with that --

565
00:34:55,432 --> 00:34:57,533
one of those halves
has to say goodbye.

566
00:34:59,703 --> 00:35:02,871
I finished tracing the
number of our rogue blur...

567
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:05,307
to R.A.O. Industries.

568
00:35:06,776 --> 00:35:08,510
It was Zod.

569
00:35:11,314 --> 00:35:13,549
Everything he said
about brotherhood,

570
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,751
it was all a lie.

571
00:35:15,785 --> 00:35:18,253
Of course he's the one
who's been using Lois.

572
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:20,622
I know you want to go and take
your anger out on Zod right now,

573
00:35:20,657 --> 00:35:22,324
but you and I both know
that there's something

574
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:23,792
you have to take care of first.

575
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:25,794
Until you can tell Lois

576
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:28,931
that you are the one and only Blur,

577
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:31,200
anyone with a voice
modulator and a calling plan

578
00:35:31,234 --> 00:35:33,836
can pretend to be you.

579
00:35:36,406 --> 00:35:39,541
I know what I have to do.

580
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,579
Hello?

581
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:46,949
Lois, thank you for coming.

582
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:49,084
Well, when The Blur leaves
a handwritten message,

583
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,053
you better believe I'm there.

584
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:52,988
Chalk it up to the curiosity

585
00:35:53,022 --> 00:35:54,957
of a recently
unemployed reporter...

586
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:57,292
but since we've been
doing this cell to cell,

587
00:35:57,327 --> 00:36:01,630
why are we back to
doing this old-school?

588
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,732
I wanted to have this conversation

589
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:06,001
in a place that meant
something to both of us.

590
00:36:06,035 --> 00:36:08,637
Wow. Sounds awfully official.

591
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:10,272
But, hey you're the boss.

592
00:36:10,306 --> 00:36:13,642
So, what's my next
impossible mission?

593
00:36:13,676 --> 00:36:15,844
There won't be one, Lois.

594
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:19,114
I'm sorry. This is our
last conversation.

595
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:24,019
Last conversation
today or for a while?

596
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:26,622
If you have to go back on
another hiatus, I understand.

597
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:29,158
I'll be there.

598
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:31,326
As in, our last talk...

599
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:32,795
Forever.

600
00:36:34,397 --> 00:36:36,265
No.

601
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:40,102
Our relationship put you at risk.

602
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:42,905
I know that we would do
anything to protect each other.

603
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:45,240
What if, one day, I'm too late?

604
00:36:45,275 --> 00:36:48,310
But you don't understand.
I don't care about the risk.

605
00:36:48,344 --> 00:36:49,845
When I'm working with you,

606
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:54,049
I'm doing something good,
something right.

607
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,952
You don't need me for that.

608
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:58,220
But I <i>do</i> need you,

609
00:36:58,254 --> 00:37:00,255
and maybe I didn't realize
it until it was too late,

610
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,458
but this the most
important part of my life.

611
00:37:04,627 --> 00:37:07,329
Well, there must be...

612
00:37:07,363 --> 00:37:10,199
some other part that
means more to you.

613
00:37:13,236 --> 00:37:15,070
When I'm with you,

614
00:37:15,104 --> 00:37:17,539
it's about more than what I want,

615
00:37:17,574 --> 00:37:19,675
who I want.

616
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:22,344
It is something that
is bigger than me.

617
00:37:25,081 --> 00:37:27,482
I wish things could
be different, Lois.

618
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:31,053
This is the only way
I can protect you.

619
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:33,889
I won't call again.

620
00:37:33,923 --> 00:37:38,327
If anyone calls
claiming to -- to be me,

621
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:39,795
don't believe them.

622
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:41,697
No matter what they
say or what happens,

623
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:43,265
you can't trust them

624
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:47,069
no, please.

625
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:54,810
I will be watching over you.

626
00:37:54,844 --> 00:37:56,211
I promise.

627
00:37:58,982 --> 00:38:01,083
Goodbye, Lois.

628
00:38:11,127 --> 00:38:14,096
Goodbye.

629
00:38:44,761 --> 00:38:47,062
I'm glad you still came up

630
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:49,031
after what we talked
about on the street.

631
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:52,634
It's beautiful, Clark.

632
00:38:52,669 --> 00:38:55,637
Thank you.

633
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:00,442
What is it, Lois?

634
00:39:02,345 --> 00:39:06,148
You know you can tell me anything.

635
00:39:06,182 --> 00:39:08,951
Can I?

636
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:10,953
Then, why did I lie to you?

637
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:16,258
We both agreed we would keep
some things to ourselves.

638
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:20,295
I've been talking
to The Blur, Clark.

639
00:39:22,765 --> 00:39:24,333
Doing things for him,

640
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:28,670
sharing things with him that
I couldn't share with you.

641
00:39:31,341 --> 00:39:33,775
It's probably just the
reporter blood in you, right?

642
00:39:35,712 --> 00:39:39,614
It was more than that.

643
00:39:39,649 --> 00:39:42,117
But we...

644
00:39:43,653 --> 00:39:46,755
I talked to him, and it's over.

645
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:50,692
He doesn't want me
in his life anymore.

646
00:39:54,397 --> 00:39:57,899
Well, there's someone standing
right here who still does.

647
00:40:00,603 --> 00:40:03,705
It's okay.

648
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:10,712
You don't have to be
okay with it, Clark.

649
00:40:17,854 --> 00:40:22,124
It's not right for me to
ask that of you, Clark.

650
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:28,230
He meant a lot to you, didn't he?

651
00:40:31,034 --> 00:40:34,436
It's not like this with you.

652
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:38,974
I wish you could understand

653
00:40:39,008 --> 00:40:42,110
what it felt like to have this...

654
00:40:42,145 --> 00:40:44,346
A calling...

655
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,450
A duty to people in -
in the world.

656
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:52,988
It..

657
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:56,191
Made my feelings for you
and everything else seem...

658
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:57,993
selfish,

659
00:40:58,027 --> 00:41:00,195
like there's a whole world
out there that needs you,

660
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:02,664
but if you take anything
from it for yourself,

661
00:41:02,698 --> 00:41:04,666
it's at someone else's expense.

662
00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:09,371
Lois, I do understand.

663
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:13,308
How?

664
00:41:16,379 --> 00:41:20,382
I guess, with him gone,
the question is...

665
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:23,318
am <i>i</i> enough?
